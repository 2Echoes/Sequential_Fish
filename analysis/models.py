1. Colocalisation model --> multicolocalization_statistics.ipynb

    We want to modelise the colocalization dynamics in case of random positioning of single molecules in the availables pixel.
    In this notation we try the colocalization between target (rna) 1 with target 2, meaning we want to know how many single molecule from
    target 1 distribution are expected to co-localize with at least one single molecule of target 2.

    * V : the total number of available positions (i.e pixel) representing the volume of a cell.
    * a1 : abundancy of target 1, i.e number of unique molecule of target 1.
    * a2 : abundancy of target 2, i.e number of unique molecule of target 2.
    * ai_unique : number of unique positions occupied by at least one single molecule of target i.
